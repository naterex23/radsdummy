<h1>Radiology Imaging Modalities</h1>
<p>Explore notes on each imaging modality commonly used in radiology, along with their applications and key findings.</p>

<h2>X-Ray</h2>
<p>X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation that can penetrate the body to create images of the internal structures. Commonly used for examining bones and certain chest and abdominal conditions.</p>

<h2>Ultrasound</h2>
<p>Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of organs and structures inside the body. It is frequently used for obstetrics, abdominal scans, and cardiac imaging.</p>

<h2>Computed Tomography (CT)</h2>
<p>CT scans use X-ray technology to create cross-sectional images of the body. CT is particularly useful for detecting cancers, vascular diseases, and trauma-related injuries.</p>

<h2>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</h2>
<p>MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues. It is especially useful for brain, spinal, and musculoskeletal imaging.</p>

<h2>Nuclear Medicine</h2>
<p>Nuclear medicine involves the use of small amounts of radioactive materials to diagnose or treat a variety of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders.</p>

<h2>Fluoroscopy</h2>
<p>Fluoroscopy provides real-time X-ray imaging, allowing for observation of moving body structures, often used during certain diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.</p>

<h2>Mammography</h2>
<p>Mammography is a specialized type of X-ray imaging used primarily for breast cancer screening and diagnosis.</p>

<h2>Interventional Radiology</h2>
<p>Interventional radiology uses imaging techniques, such as X-ray, CT, and ultrasound, to guide minimally invasive surgical procedures.</p>
