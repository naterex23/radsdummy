  <p>Classically an encapsulated mass that enchances on arterial phases and washes out w/ enchancing capsule. Difficult to detect on non/portal venous phase CT. Slightly hyperintense on T2 may show fluid restriction. </p>

<p> Fibrolamellar Carcinoma is a rare HCC subtype in younger patients without HCC. No AFP elevation. Large heterogenous mass w/ classic central scar that is hypointense on T1+T2.</p>
